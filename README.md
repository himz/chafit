CharFit

Made at hackNY Fall 2012

We at Charfit want to help encourage people to go to the gym. We allow you to set your own goals on how much you want to work out in a given week, and then we track your progress by your checkins at foursquare. If you do not complete you goal then we donate some of your money to a charity of your choice. This gives people that the extra incentive that they need to finish your goals, while also helping those who are less fortunate.

We used CartoDB to display the map, handle payments via Venmo, Twilio to send a confirmation message to the user, and we post a message to Tumblr.

We used 6 APIs.
